Administration Manual
============

The extension is pretty straight forward in itÄs handling.

It does **not** check wether an user is already in the system or not.

The username can be varied per typoscript.

The passwords that are automatically set for each user follow the scheme ``{prefix}_{username}_pwd_0102`` and they are shown after the import is done.
