What does it do?
----------------

The extension delivers a method to add loads of backendusers via importing a csv file.

At the moment it is only possible to import users to exactly one beusergroup!

.. important::

   Please don't forget to repeat your extension's version number in the
   :file:`Settings.yml` file, in the :code:`release` property. It will be
   automatically picked up on the cover page by the :code:`|release|`
   substitution.
